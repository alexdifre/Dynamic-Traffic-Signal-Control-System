    "# Weekly Report 3\n",
    "\n",
    "## What did I do this week?\n",
    "This week I focused entirely on testing and documentation. I implemented a comprehensive test suite in `test_environment.py` with 6 critical unit tests covering:\n",
    "- Reward calculation correctness (positive/negative/zero rewards)\n",
    "- Simulation execution and state cache updates\n",
    "- State tuple structure validation\n",
    "- Multi-step reward consistency and invariants\n",
    "- Episode termination flags (terminated vs truncated)\n",
    "- Environment reset initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "I also wrote complete project documentation including the specification document, implementation document, and testing document following the course requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How has the program progressed?\n",
    "The program is now complete and well-tested. All 6 unit tests pass successfully:\n",
    "- Reward calculation produces mathematically correct values\n",
    "- Simulation steps execute and update cache properly\n",
    "- State structure matches expected format (signal, lane_a, lane_b, occupied)\n",
    "- Reward consistency holds across multiple steps (sum equals net flow)\n",
    "- Termination flags work correctly for different scenarios\n",
    "- Reset properly initializes new episodes\n",
    "\n",
    "## What did I learn this week/today?\n",
    "I learned important lessons about testing reinforcement learning systems:\n",
    "- **Critical invariants**: Identifying properties that, if violated, break learning entirely (e.g., reward calculation, state structure)\n",
    "- **Mock testing**: Using `unittest.mock` to isolate components and test RL logic independently from the simulator\n",
    "- **Test design**: Focusing tests on critical correctness rather than coverage percentage - 6 well-designed tests are better than 50 superficial ones\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What remains unclear or has been challenging?\n",
    "The main challenge this week was deciding what to test:\n",
    "- **Coverage vs criticality**: Should I aim for high code coverage or focus on critical paths? I chose the latter\n",
    "- **Mocking complexity**: The traffic simulator is complex, and creating proper mocks required understanding its internal structure deeply\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing complexity analysis was also challenging - especially proving the O(|S| × |A|) space complexity when |S| grows  during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will I do next?\n",
    "- Review all documentation for clarity and completeness\n",
    "- Possibly add more evaluation runs to gather statistical confidence\n",
    "- Consider adding performance graphs showing learning curves if time permits\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "- I would like to know if these tests are appropriate.\n",
    "- I would like to know if these tests are sufficient or I have to do also the Q-learning functions test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatgpt was used for rewriting in a clearly and correctly way  the concepts illustrated in this weekly report.\n",

    "**Hours logged this week:** 14 hours\n",

    "**Total hours logged:** 44 hours"
