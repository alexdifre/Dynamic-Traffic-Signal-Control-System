    "# Weekly Report 5\n",
    "\n",
    "## What did I do this week?\n",
    "This week I focused on developing a comprehensive test suite for my Q-Learning implementation . I adapted testing guidelines originally designed for neural networks to the reinforcement learning context, creating automated tests that verify the correctness of my Q-Learning agent. I implemented a simple 5x5 grid world environment as the testing ground, where an agent must learn to navigate from the start position (0,0) to the goal position (4,4). The environment provides a reward of +10 for reaching the goal and a small penalty of -0.1 for each step to encourage efficient path-finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How has the program progressed?\n",
    "I have:\n",
    "- Implemented a `SimpleGridWorld` environment with 25 states and 4 possible actions (up, down, left, right)\n",
    "- Created a `QLearningAgent` class with epsilon-greedy action selection and standard Q-Learning update rules\n",
    "- Developed 4 core automated tests following neural network testing best practices:\n",
    "  1. **Q-values update test**: Verifies that learning mechanism is working (analog to \"gradients are non-zero\")\n",
    "  2. **Q-values increase test**: Ensures values improve over time (analog to \"loss decreases\")\n",
    "  3. **Near-optimal path test**: Validates solution quality (agent finds paths within 2 steps of the 8-step optimal)\n",
    "  4. **Bellman equation test**: Checks mathematical correctness of learned Q-values\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensured reproducibility by fixing random seeds (seed=42) for all tests\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests run automatically and provide clear pass/fail feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What did I learn this week/today?\n",
    "I gained valuable insights into software engineering practices for machine learning systems:\n",
    "- **Testing RL is different from testing traditional code**: Instead of checking exact outputs, I test properties (Q-values increase, agent reaches goal, Bellman equation approximately holds)\n",
    "- **Property-based testing**: Mathematical properties (like Bellman optimality equation) can be verified even when exact values are unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "I also learned that testing RL algorithms requires thinking about:\n",
    "- Whether all states receive updates (exploration is working)\n",
    "- Whether learning converges (Q-values stabilize)\n",
    "- Whether solutions are not just correct but also high-quality (near-optimal paths)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What remains unclear or has been challenging?\n",
    "Some challenges I encountered during test development:\n",
    "- **Tolerance levels**: Determining appropriate tolerances for tests like Bellman equation validation (I used 20%) - I'm uncertain if this is too lenient or too strict\n",
    "- **Training episodes**: Finding the right number of episodes (2000-3000) for reliable test results without making tests too slow\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will I do next?\n",
    "Next week I will:\n",
    "- Refine and finalize the draft tests for other utility functions that are currently only in preliminary form\n",
    "- Complete the remaining test cases that were outlined but not yet fully implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm also uncertain about Whether I should add more tests or if these are sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT was used for rewriting in a more clearly and correctly way the concepts illustrated in this weekly report.\n",
    "It also help me to write the visual demonstration of trained agent \"run_visual_demo\" and the class \"SimpleGridWorld\" for the grid environment.\n",
