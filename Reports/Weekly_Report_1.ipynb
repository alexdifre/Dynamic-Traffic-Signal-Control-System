    "## What did I do this week?\n",
    "This week I focused on setting up the development environment and understanding the project structure. I explored the trafficSimulator repository (BilHim/trafficSimulator) to understand how the traffic simulation works. I used ChatGPT to help clarify some concepts about the simulator's API and how to properly interface with it. I also set up the basic project structure with the necessary directories and initial configuration files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How has the program progressed?\n",
    "The program is in its initial setup phase. I have successfully:\n",
    "- Cloned and explored the traffic simulator repository\n",
    "- Created the basic project structure with folders for reinforcement learning code, documentation, and tests\n",
    "- Understood the simulator's state representation (traffic signal phases, vehicle counts, lane configurations)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What did I learn this week/today?\n",
    "I learned how the traffic simulator represents intersections and manages vehicle flow. Specifically:\n",
    "- How the simulator tracks vehicles in different lanes\n",
    "- The state representation including signal phases and queue lengths\n",
    "- How to initialize a two-way intersection simulation\n",
    "- The basic workflow of running simulation steps and extracting observations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What remains unclear or has been challenging?\n",
    "I'm still uncertain about:\n",
    "- The exact reward function design - should I penalize long queues or reward queue reduction?\n",
    "- How to handle the transition between traffic light phases (minimum green time, yellow light duration)\n",
    "- The optimal state space representation - should I include more features like waiting times or keep it simple?\n",
    "- How many vehicles to spawn and what traffic patterns to use for realistic training\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will I do next?\n",
    "Next week I will:\n",
    "- Implement the Environment wrapper class that interfaces with the traffic simulator\n",
    "- Create the basic Q-learning agent class with the Q-table structure\n",
    "- Test the environment-simulator integration to ensure state observations are correct\n",
    "- Start thinking about hyperparameter choices (learning rate, discount factor, epsilon)\n",

    "Chatgpt was used for rewriting in a clearly and correctly way  the concepts illustrated in this weekly report.\n",
