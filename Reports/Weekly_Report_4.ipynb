    "## What did I do this week?\n",
    "This week I focused on hyperparameter optimization to improve the agent's learning performance. I implemented a systematic grid search to find the optimal combination of learning rate (ALPHA), discount factor (GAMMA), and initial exploration rate (EPSILON), while keeping EPSILON_MIN = 0.01 and EPSILON_DECAY = 0.995 constant. I ran multiple training sessions with different parameter combinations and evaluated each configuration based on average reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How has the program progressed?\n",
    "The program has improved through hyperparameter tuning. I have :\n",
    "- Implemented grid search functionality to test multiple parameter combinations\n",
    "- Tested 12 different configurations (3 values for each of ALPHA, 2 for GAMMA and EPSILON)\n",
    "- Identified the optimal configuration: ALPHA = 0.15, GAMMA = 0.5, EPSILON = 0.1\n",
    "- Validated the results across multiple independent training runs\n",
    "- performance improvements: 7.6% reduction in average reward\n",

    "## What did I learn this week/today?\n",
    "I learned important lessons about hyperparameter optimization in reinforcement learning:\n",
    "- **Learning rate impact**: Higher learning rates caused instability, while lower rates (α < 0.03) learned too slowly\n",
    "- **Initial exploration importance**: Starting with ε = 0.1 allowed sufficient early exploration before the decay reduced it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What remains unclear or has been challenging?\n",
    "Some challenges I encountered during hyperparameter tuning:\n",
    "- **Local optima**: I'm not certain if the current configuration is globally optimal or just locally optimal within my search space\n",
    "- **Parameter interactions**: Understanding why certain combinations work better than others is not always intuitive\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm also uncertain whether I should expand the search space (test more values) or if the current configuration is sufficient for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will I do next?\n",
    "Next week I will:\n",
    "- I  write the test algorithms for the Reinforcement Learning (RL) section, following the guidelines provided by my instructors\n",

    "ChatGPT was used for rewriting in a more clearly and correctly way the concepts illustrated in this weekly report.\n",
